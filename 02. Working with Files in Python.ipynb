      "Most asked Interview Question  \n",
      "1. What is Quality Assurance (QA)? \n",
      "• QA is a systematic process to ensure that software products meet specified \n",
      "quality standards and requirements. For example, testing a mobile app to ensure \n",
      "all functionalities work correctly before release. \n",
      "2. What is the software testing life cycle? \n",
      "• The software testing life cycle includes phases such as requirements analysis, \n",
      "test planning, test case development, test environment setup, test execution, \n",
      "defect reporting, and test closure. \n",
      "3. Can you explain the difference between manual testing and automated testing? \n",
      "• Manual testing involves human testers executing test cases without automation \n",
      "tools, while automated testing uses software tools to run tests automatically, \n",
      "increasing efficiency and coverage. \n",
      "4. What are some common automation testing tools you have used? \n",
      "• I have experience with Selenium, TestNG, JUnit, Cucumber, and Appium, among \n",
      "others. \n",
      "5. When would you choose to automate a test? \n",
      "• I would automate tests for repetitive tasks, regression tests, and tests that \n",
      "require high precision or need to be executed frequently. \n",
