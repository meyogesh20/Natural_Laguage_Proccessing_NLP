    "\n",
    "# ⚙️ Steps in NLP\n",
    "Natural Language Processing typically involves the following key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Tokenization\n",
    "Breaking a sentence into smaller units called tokens (usually words or subwords).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"Add eggs and milk\" → [\"Add\", \"eggs\", \"and\", \"milk\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Stemming\n",
    "Reducing words to their root form by trimming suffixes/prefixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"running\", \"ran\", \"runs\" → run\n",
    "\n",
    "❗ Note: Stemming can be crude or inaccurate:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"university\" and \"universal\" do not reduce to \"universe\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Lemmatization\n",
    "Identifies the dictionary root (lemma) of a word based on its context and meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"better\" → good (correct lemma)\n",
    "Stemming version: \"better\" → \"bet\" (inaccurate)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Lemmatization is more accurate and meaningful than stemming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ Part of Speech (POS) Tagging\n",
    "Assigns a grammatical role to each token in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\"book\" as a noun → I read a book.\n",
    "\"book\" as a verb → Please book a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
    "Detects and classifies named entities (proper nouns) in text into categories like:\n",
    "\n",
    "👩 Person — e.g., Maria\n",
    "\n",
    "🌍 Location — e.g., London\n",
    "\n",
    "🏢 Organization — e.g., Google\n",
    "\n",
    "📅 Date — e.g., July 5, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "NER is useful in extracting structured data from unstructured text.\n"
